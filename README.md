This project is based on the Git repo as follows:

# PyLMDI: An open source toolbox for LMDI decomposition analysis in Python

## Quick User Guide
This version of PyLMDI has been adjusted to be much easier to use and understand. It is a work in progress for APERC staff but it can be used by anyone.

It is expected that this project will remain easy to use and understand so as to encourage its use rather than seem too academic. 

You can easily understand the use of this project by viewing the files in /saved_runs/. 

The inputs need to be similar to what has currently been used, but this is expected to be simple to copy. To do so take a look at the saved_runs code and how the input data was structured and manipulated to make it work.

There is the capcaity to create graphs from the outputs using plotly.

But unfortunately I cannot find any links to the method for multiple structural drivers that arent behind paywalls.
